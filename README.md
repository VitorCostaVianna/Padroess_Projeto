📖 About

Design patterns are proven solutions to recurring problems in software design. This repository showcases examples of creational, structural, and behavioral patterns with clean, well-documented code in a single language (Java). Each pattern comes with a concise explanation and practical code implementation.

🛠️ Design Patterns Covered
Creational Patterns
Singleton: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to it.
Factory Method: Creates objects without specifying the exact class.

Structural Patterns
Adapter: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
Decorator: Dynamically adds responsibilities to objects.

Behavioral Patterns
Observer: Allows objects to notify others about changes in their state.

💻 Usage
Learning Tool: Study how design patterns are implemented with real-world examples.
Reference: Use this repository as a quick guide when applying patterns in your projects.
Exercises: Modify the examples or create your own implementations to deepen your understanding.
